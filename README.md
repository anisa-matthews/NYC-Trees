# NYC-Trees
A tool for visualizing popularity of specific tree species in different boroughs of New York City. Uses the 2015 Street Tree Census data provided by Department of Parks and Recreation. Using this data and a name of the tree specified by the user, my program generates information about popularity of this type of tree in each borough of New York City.

This was my first project in my Data Structures course, implementing the binary search tree data structure.
